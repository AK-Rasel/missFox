## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Vite React**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or use an alternative package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
- **Git**: Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
Create a .env file in the root of the project to define your environment-specific variables. Use the .env.example file as a reference.
```

#### Environment Variables

To configure the project, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following keys:

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: OpenAI API Key for accessing AI services.
- **CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID**: Cloudflare account ID for managing Cloudflare services.
- **R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: Access key ID for Cloudflare R2 storage.
- **R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: Secret key for R2 access (keep secure).
- **R2_BUCKET_NAME**: Name of the R2 storage bucket.

- **Security**: Ensure these keys remain secure and are not shared publicly.
